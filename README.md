# vue-parcel-boilerplate

> A full-featured Parcel setup with hot-reload, unit testing & css extraction.

> This template is Vue 2.0 compatible.

## Documentation

- [For Vue 2.0](http://vuejs.org/guide/): general information about how to work with Vue, not specific to this template

## Usage

This is a project template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli). **It is recommended to use npm 3+ for a more efficient dependency tree.**

``` bash
$ npm install -g vue-cli
$ vue init osk2/parcel-vuejs-template my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

The development server will run on port 1234 by default. If that port is already in use on your machine, the next free port will be used.

## What's Included

- `npm run dev`: first-in-class development experience.
  - Hot-reload
  - Source maps

- `npm run unit`: Unit tests run in [JSDOM](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
  - Supports ES2015+ in test files.
  - Easy mocking.
